As a tech enthusiast I love to write tech blogs, In these blogs I have penned down my understanding of the some of the concepts. 

By writing these blogs it makes me understand the concepts in much better manner.

This tech blog is developed using gatsby templates.

official documentation - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/

For hosting of this tech blog I have used netlify deploy service.

Steps for hosting websites in Netlify 

1) Have your static or statically generated website. A static site, statically generated blog with something like Gatsby, or even a Jamstack site (but this requires a little more setup).

2) Push your code to GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab

3) Create a Netlify Account. Go signup and signup with the hosting provider of your code.

4) In your "Overview" page select New site from Git.

5) Select the repo you want to deploy. Then you'll need to enter the build command and the folder for Netlify to distribute. Something like parcel build index.html and dist if you are deploying a static site with Parcel

6)Wait for your app to deploy! Netlify will now start building and deploying your website. In a few minutes, Netlify will give you a URL to view your website and your website will be deployed.
